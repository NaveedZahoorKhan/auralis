## 2024-08-22 - Unlabelled Icon Buttons in State changes
**Learning:** When conditionally removing text labels from UI elements to save space (like unselected tabs), it creates "unlabelled button" traps for screen readers if the remaining icon doesn't have a contentDescription.
**Action:** Always map the original text label to the icon's contentDescription in the reduced/collapsed state.
## 2026-08-23 - UI Organization using Material 3
**Learning:** Replacing custom navigation UI with standard Material 3 components like `NavigationBar` and using overflow menus greatly reduces visual clutter and improves standard Android UX compliance.
**Action:** Replaced scrollable `ModeTabs` with `NavigationBar` in Scaffold's `bottomBar` and moved secondary `TopAppBar` actions to an overflow `DropdownMenu`.
