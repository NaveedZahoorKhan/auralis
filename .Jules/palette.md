## 2024-08-22 - Unlabelled Icon Buttons in State changes
**Learning:** When conditionally removing text labels from UI elements to save space (like unselected tabs), it creates "unlabelled button" traps for screen readers if the remaining icon doesn't have a contentDescription.
**Action:** Always map the original text label to the icon's contentDescription in the reduced/collapsed state.
